Prediction of Kitchen Layout and Charecteristics using Mobile Camera and LIDAR data.

Problem statement : 

       a)Kitchen Remodeling - Customers don't have a way to find suitable products fit for their needs and kitchens. No application available to provide real-time estimates of remodeling costs. 
       b)Physical Quotes - Remodeling requires contractors to visit your home and estimate the costs. Also no DIY or pandemic friendly options available.

Existing Difficulties : 

       There aren't enough open-source datasets to train a classification model for kitchens. To predict meaningful classifiers with high accuracy, a large dataset is required. For a real-time solution, low latency is required. 
       
Software Tools Used :
   a) Python Flask
   b) Tensorflow
   c) Android / MLKit
   d) AWS
